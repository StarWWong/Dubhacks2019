1. Review
(a) Partial Fraction Expansion. In Ch.4 and Ch.9, you will need to be familiar with a method called partial fraction expansion (PFE). We will spend a few weeks reviewing this week starting with this homework.
i. (2 pts) Let X(s) = (s+2)/(s^2+7*s+12). Using the cover-up method for partial fraction expansion (discussed in the supplementary notes), write H(s) as a sum of partial fractions. Show that X(s) = 2/(s+4)−1/(s+3).
ii. (4 pts) Let X(s) = (2+2s+s^2)/(1+s)(6+5s+s^2) . Using the cover-up method for partial fraction expansion (discussed in the supplementary notes), write X(s) as a sum of partial fractions.
(b) Complex Numbers and Magnitude-Squared. In Ch.3 and Ch.4, you will rely on the concept of magnitude-squared again that was discussed first in HW1. We will use this section to review that concept on different problem types.
i. (4 pts) Using properties of complex conjugates, evaluate the following:∣∣∣∣1/2∣∣∣∣^2 + ∣∣∣∣1/2∣∣∣∣^2 + ∣∣∣∣1/j∣∣∣∣^2 + ∣∣∣∣−1/j∣∣∣∣^2 + ∣∣2e^j*π/3∣∣2 + ∣∣2e^−j*(π/3)∣∣^2
ii. (2 pts) Consider a complex function X(jω) plotted below versus frequency ω
Using this information, evaluate the following integral:
∞∫−∞|X(jω)|2 dω
This integral type will be important for Ch.4. Show that this integral evaluates to 10.
iii. (4 pts) Consider a complex function X(jω) plotted below versus frequency ω

Using this information, evaluate the following integral:
∞∫−∞|X(jω)|2 dω
This integral type will be important for Ch.4.
(c) Complex Functions and Euler’s Formula. In Ch.3, we will need to be fluent in using different versions of Euler’s formula in order to convert between sinusoids and complex exponentials. We will use this problem as an opportunity to do that. See Supplementary notes for a summary of Euler’s formulas.
i. (2 pts) Using Euler’s formulas, convert f(t) = 2 cos(6t+ π/4 ) + 3 sin(4t) into a sum of weighted complex exponential functions e^j*ω*t where ω can be any real number.
Your answer should be in the form of a sum of Aejωt where A is a complex number.
Show that f(t) = (e^j*π/4)*(e^j*6*t + e^−j*(π/4)*e^−j*6*t + (3/2*j)e^-j*4*t)
ii. (4 pts) Using Euler’s formulas, convert f(t) = 8cos((π/3)*t) − 2*sin((3π/4)*t) into a sum of weighted complex exponential functions e^j*ω*t where ω can be any real number.
Your answer should be in the form of a sum of Aejωt where A is a complex number.
iii. (2 pts) Using Euler’s formulas, convert f(t) = je^j*3*t + (1/4)e^j*(π/3)*e^-j*2*t into a sum of sinusoidal functions of the form Asin(ωot+ θ) or Acos(ωot+ θ).
Show that f(t) = −2sin(3t) + (1/2)cos(2t−π/3)
iv. (4 pts) Using Euler’s formulas, convert f(t) = je^j*π/20*t + (2e^−j*π/3)*(e^j*π/4)t− je^−jπ/20*t + 2e^jπ/3e^−j*(π/4)*t into a sum of sinusoidal functions of the form Asin(ωot + θ) or Acos(ωot + θ).
