3. ROC and Signal Properties. (10 pts)
(a) (5 pts) Suppose x(t) is a real signal with rational Laplace transform X(s) with the following
properties:
i. X(s) has two poles and one zero, with one pole at s = −1− 2j,
ii. the Fourier transform of e2tx(t) does not exist,
iii. ∫∞ −∞ x(t)dt = −2,
iv. ∫∞ −∞ e^(-tx(t))dt = 0.
Find x(t) (the time-domain signal).
(b) (5 pts) Signal x(t) has the following properties:
i. X(s) is rational with 1 zero and 2 poles
ii. x(t) is real
iii. X(s) has its zero at s = 1 and a known pole at s = 1 - 2j
iv. Area under x(t) is equal to 1
v. e^−3tx(t) is absolutely integrable (so Fourier Transform of e^−3tx(t) does exist)
Deduce the expression for signal x(t).



4. ROC and LTI Systems. (16 pts)
(a) (5 pts) Consider another system described by: −2y(t)− dy(t)/dt + d2y(t)/dt = 3x(t) + dx(t)/dt.
i. (1 pt) Specify the ROC corresponding to H(s) if it is known the system is causal. Also, sketch
the pole-zero plot and associated ROC.
ii. (2 pts) Specify the ROC corresponding to H(s) if it is known the system is stable. Also,
sketch the pole-zero plot and associated ROC.
iii. (2 pts) Specify the ROC corresponding to H(s) if it is known the system is left-sided. Also,
sketch the pole-zero plot and associated ROC.
(b) (5 pts) Let H(s) represent the system function for a causal, stable LTI system. The input to the
system consists of the sum of three terms, one of which is an impulse δ(t) and the second term is
a complex exponential es0t, where s0 is a complex constant. The output of the system is:y(t) = e^−tu(t) + 10 3/4e^4t cos(3t) + 6 3/4 e^4t sin(3t).
Determine h(t) and s0 consistent with this information.
Hint1: What happens when a complex exponential is passed through an LTI system?
Hint2: One thing to note is that the output is real even if s0 was complex. This indicates that
the third term consists of es∗0t, where s∗0 is the complex conjugate of s0.
(c) For each of the cases below, draw a pole-zero plot and ROC for a system that matches the
description:
i. (2 pts) The system is stable; the impulse response is two-sided; and the system frequency
response approaches a non-zero constant at high frequencies.
ii. (2 pts) The system is not stable and contains complex poles in the left half plane.
iii. (2 pts) The impulse-response is two-sided and absolutely integrable, and the system behaves
like a lowpass filter.
