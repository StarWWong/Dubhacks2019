1. Review (15 pts)
(a) (5 pts) LTI Systems.
Consider two LTI subsystems that are connected in cascade, where system T1 has step response
s1(t) = u(t− 2)−u(t− 6) and system T2 has impulse response h2(t) = e−4tu(t). Find the overall
impulse response h(t).
(b) (5 pts) Fourier Series.
The input signal x(t) and the impulse response h(t) of the system is given as follows:
x(t) = sin(2t)cos(t)− ej3t + 2 and h(t) = sin(2t)t
Using Fourier Series, find the output y(t).
(c) (5 pts) Parseval’s Theorem.
Let’s consider the system in Problem 1-(b). Using Parseval’s Theorem, compute the power P∞
of the output y(t) and the energy E∞ of the impulse response h(t).

(a) (5 pts) Let’s consider the LTI system with the impulse response h(t) = 5e−3tu(t). And the input
