1. Review
(a) Partial Fraction Expansion. In Ch.4 and Ch.9, you will need to be familiar with a method called
partial fraction expansion (PFE). We will spend a few weeks reviewing this week starting with
this homework.
i. (2 pts) Let X(s) = s+2s2+7s+12 . Using the cover-up method for partial fraction expansion
(discussed in the supplementary notes), write H(s) as a sum of partial fractions. Show that
X(s) = 2s+4 −

s+3 .
ii. (4 pts) Let X(s) = 2+2s+s
2
(1+s)(6+5s+s2) . Using the cover-up method for partial fraction expansion
(discussed in the supplementary notes), write X(s) as a sum of partial fractions.
(b) Complex Numbers and Magnitude-Squared. In Ch.3 and Ch.4, you will rely on the concept of
magnitude-squared again that was discussed first in HW1. We will use this section to review that
concept on different problem types.

∣∣∣∣2 + ∣∣∣∣−1j
∣∣∣∣2 + ∣∣2ej π3 ∣∣2 + ∣∣2e−j π3 ∣∣2
ii. (2 pts) Consider a complex function X(jω) plotted below versus frequency ω
Using this information, evaluate the following integral:
∞∫

(c) Complex Functions and Euler’s Formula. In Ch.3, we will need to be fluent in using different
versions of Euler’s formula in order to convert between sinusoids and complex exponentials. We
will use this problem as an opportunity to do that. See Supplementary notes for a summary of
Euler’s formulas.
