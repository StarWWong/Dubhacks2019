not.

3. LTI Systems.
You have an LTI system, but you don’t know the system equation as shown in the figure below.
However, you know that y1(t) is the output of the system when the input is x1(t). x1(t) and y1(t) are
given as below.

(a) (2 pts) Sketch y2(t) when the input is x2(t) where x2(t) is given as below. Show that sketch of
y2(t) is as shown in the figure below.
(b) (4 pts) Sketch y3(t) which is the output of the system when the input is x3(t) where x3(t) is given
as below.



4. Impulse Response.

−∞ e
−(t−τ)x(τ − 2)dτ .

ii. (1 pt) Based on this input-output relationship, state if the system is causal or not.
Hint: The relationship between x(t), y(t), and h(t) is given by convolution: y(t) = x(t)∗h(t).
(c) (2pts) You got an awesome bluetooth speaker as Christmas present. Unfortunately your cat
played with it, and it’s now damaged. The speaker plays music amplified by whatever volume
you choose; but in addition to this, you can hear distortion in the form of music from two seconds
ago, amplified at a tenth of the selected volume. Assuming the speaker to be a simple LTI system,
what is the input-output relationship? Express this in terms of the selected volume, v.
(2 pts) Also compute the impulse response of the system from this relationship.
Hint: The output is a sum of two signals, one good, one distorted. What is another word for
‘amplified’ in the language of signal operations you learnt in class? Note that the good signal
only has amplification. The distorted signal, on the other hand, has amplification (at a different
level!), but also, it is from some time before the current time - so what transformation was applied
to the input to generate this distortion?
(d) (2 pts) The input-output relationship of an RL circuit (which is an LTI system) is given by y(t) =
R
L
∫ t
τ=−∞ x(τ)e
−RL (t−τ)dτ , where R and L are the circuit resistance and inductance, respectively.
Compute the impulse response of the system.

δ(t − kT ), for some positive
value of T . Suppose the input to this system is the signal shown in Figure 1. Sketch the output
for T = 1 and T = 2.
(b) (2 pts) Consider an LTI system with input x(t) = 12 (u(t) − u(t − 2)) and impulse response
h(t) = 3δ(t+ 1) − δ(t− 3).
Show that y(t) = 32u(t+ 1) −

(c) (4 pts) Consider an LTI system with input x(t) = δ(t) + 2δ(t − 4) and impulse response h(t) =
cos(t). What is the output?

(a) (2 pts) Consider x(t) = e−(t−2)u(t) and h(t) = u(t + 3). Find y(t). Represent y(t) in terms of
u(t). Show that y(t) = e2(1 − e−(t+3))u(t+ 3).
(b) (4 pts) x(t) = etu(−4 − t) and h(t) = e−2tu(t+ 2). Find y(t) where y(t) = x(t) ∗ h(t). Represent
y(t) in terms of u(t). Also plot h(t− τ).
