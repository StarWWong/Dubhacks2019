1. Review
(a) Complex Numbers. (2 pts) In Ch.3, you will need to be comfortable working with equations with
complex numbers and terms. Here is one problem for you to practice your skills. Consider the
following equation where s is complex:
H(s) = 3e2s
Using H(s) above, evaluate and simplify as much as possible the following equation y(t) =
1
2H(j5)e
j5t + 12H(−j5)e
−j5t. Hint: Use Euler’s formulas.
(b) Integration We will use this problem to continue practice doing multivariable integration. In
Ch.2, you will need to evaluate a so-called running integral where the upper bound is a variable
as shown below:
s(t) =
∫ t
−∞
h(τ)dτ
Because t is a variable and changing values, the answer for s(t) will also be a function of t – that
is, for different regions of t, you will get a different equation for s(t). See Supplementary Notes
for an example. Evaluate the integral above for the following cases:
i. (2 pts) h(τ) =
{



3, τ > −1



0, τ < −1
Show that s(t) =
{



0, t < −1
3(t+ 1), t > −1
ii. (4 pts) h(τ) =
{



0, τ > 0
e2τ , τ < 0
(c) Periodicity and Even/Odd. (4 pts)
Let z(t) = sin3(4t) + e−j6t. Find the odd z0(t) part of z(t). Is the odd part of z(t) periodic?



2. Energy and Power
(a) (2 pts) x(t) = e−atu(−t), a > 0. Evaluate E∞ and P∞. Is x(t) an energy signal or a power signal?
Show that x(t) is not an energy signal and not a power signal.
1
(b) (2 pts) Find the energy E∞ and power P∞ of the signal x(t) = cos
2(2t). Is this an energy signal
or a power signal? Show that x(t) has infinite energy but finite power with P∞ =
3
8 , so hence it
is a power signal .
Hint: The power of a periodic signal can be calculated from the power in one period.
(c) (4 pts) Find the energy E∞ and power P∞ of the signal x(t) is defined as below. Is this an energy
signal or a power signal?

4. Causal.
Consider the following input-output relationships of a system:
2
(a) (2 pts) y(t) = x(t− 3)− x(3− t). Is the system causal? Show that the system is not causal.
(b) (4 pts) y(t) = x(t/4). Is the system causal?

(e) (4 pts) The input-output relationship is given as:
y(t) = x(t+ 3a− 2b+ 4). Given input-output relationship, determine the values of b in terms of
a that will make the system causal.



5. Stable.
Consider the following input-output relationships of a system:
(a) (2 pts) y(t) = x(t)(x(t− k)) where k is a real number. Is the system stable?
Show that the system is stable by showing that it has a constant upper bound.
(b) (2 pts) y(t) =

6. Invertible.
Given the following input-output relationships of different systems find out if the system is invertible
or not; if so, derive the inverse. Justify your answer in both cases.
(a) (2 pts) y(t) = x(t/3). Is this system invertible?
Show that it is.
(b) (2 pts) y(t) =
{
x3(t) if t > 2
0 otherwise
. Is this system invertible?
Show that it is NOT invertible.
(c) (4 pts) y(t) = tx(t). Is this system invertible?
(d) (4 pts) y(t) =
(
x(t)
)k
, where k is an integer. Is the system invertible?
Hint : Think of two cases, one when k is odd, second when k is even. It might help to draw a
picture of
(
x(t)
)k
for a couple of small values of k to guess what the answer might be; once you
guess it, you can prove invertibility or non-invertibility for each of the two cases.

lecture.
